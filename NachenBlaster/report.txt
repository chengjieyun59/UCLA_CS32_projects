2. 
After 49 hours of coding, fixing hundreds of bugs, and having dreams about coding the project… plus 6 hours of office hours, 4 TA’s help, and 41 GitHub commits (https://github.com/chengjieyun59/UCLA_CS32_projects/commits/master), I’m proud to say that I believe that I have successfully finished all functionalities in the 51-page spec, which I’ve read around a dozen times in detail. My code passes the sanity check and never crashes as far as I’ve tried.


3.
I think every behavior has been defined pretty clearly in the spec or is clearly shown in the example game that I played. So I didn’t have to make any assumptions, but I did make some decisions. I was thinking if I should include Nachenblaster in the actor vector or not, and had 2 different ways of making it work. I later decided that it was easier to just not include Nachenblaster in the actor vector, and deal with it specifically for certain things. For the parts where two actors collide, I made sure that I only choose one class to implement it, so I didn’t accidentally make things happen twice. So I just picked the ones that were easier to implement because of the getOneCollidingAlien and getCollidingPlayer functions in StudentWorld. Details are described in the comments of partial code shown in section 1 below. 


4.
The sanity check was one of the ways I tested my program. When the sanity check for part 2 was posted, my project failed the sanity test. At first, it was creating more one alien per tick, because of a misunderstanding of the English used in the spec. Once that’s fixed, it included a BAD_EXE error message and couldn’t compile when going to Move 2 Part of the sanity check. I realized that I was trying to access Nachenblaster even though it has become a null pointer. The checks I made for each class is described at the end of every class or groups of class in section 1 below.


1.
My overall Actor inheritance hierarchy looks like this:
GraphObject
    Actor
        Star
        Explosion
        DamageableObject
            Player
            Alien
                Smallgon
                Smoregon
                Snagglegon
        Projectile
            Cabbage
            Turnip
            Torpedo
                PlayerLaunchedTorpedo
                AlienLaunchedTorpedo
        Goodie
            ExtraLifeGoodie
            RepairGoodie
            TorpedoGoodie

///////////
// Actor //
///////////

// Actor constructor
    Actor(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY, int dir, double size, int depth);

// the destructor of any base classes should always be virtual
    virtual ~Actor();

// if the actor is within the screen, return true. This can be used to decide when to destroy actors that go off the screen.
    bool isInBound(int x, int y) const;

// this helps me check if an actor is alive. If not, don’t make it doSomething
    bool isAlive() const;

// All the following accessors function are helpful to see what to delete (Ex: star), what specific flight plan needs to be chosen (Ex: isSmoregon(), isSnagglegon()) in the base class function implementation directly (Ex: Alien). Of course, all these return false here, but true in the respective subclasses.
    virtual bool isAlien() const;
    virtual bool isStar() const;
    virtual bool isNachenBlaster() const;
    virtual bool isSmoregon() const;
    virtual bool isSnagglegon() const;
    virtual bool isProjectile() const;
    virtual bool isTorpedo() const;

// This is a very important function that returns a pointer to the StudentWorld, so that I can access any public member functions in the StudentWorld from my Actor class, simply by using getWorld()->functionName();
    StudentWorld* getWorld() const;

// This makes me able to set an actor dead, so it can later be deleted
    virtual void setAlive(std::string aliveStatus);

// I made this pure virtual function, because Actor class is never meant to be called directly, and whatever I type in the implementation would have been dummy code. Every actor must doSomething anyway, and this ensures that I always define this function in Actor’s subclasses, or there would be an error.
    virtual void doSomething() = 0;

I tested if I really couldn’t initiate the Actor class. Tested that isInBound and isAlive returns the correct thing through cassert. Made sure that setAlive(“dead”) indeed changes the alive status through cassert. Made sure that the getWorld()->someFunction does work on Star in part 1 of homework submission. 

//////////
// Star //
//////////

// Star constructor
    Star(StudentWorld* World, double startX);

// the destructor here doesn’t have to be virtual, but just to stay safer, in case I ever want to create a subclass of Star, I made it virtual here. In fact, I made all my destructors that inherit from the Actor base class virtual. And I will stop talking about destructors in other Actor subclasses.
    virtual ~Star();

// the stars just have to keep moving left, and make stars dead if it goes off the left side of the screen
    virtual void doSomething();

I checked to make sure that every star moves left after being created on the screen, and that each gets deleted correctly with no BAD_EXE error when cleaning up in StudentWorld for part 1 of the project. Also that stars are indeed created on the right of the screen.

///////////////
// Explosion //
///////////////

// Explosion constructor
    Explosion(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY, double size);

// the size of the explosion has to increase from 1.5 to 2.25 to 3.375 to 5.0625 in four ticks, and then set it dead.
    virtual void doSomething();

I made sure that explosion does look like it’s increasing in size three times since it was created just by looking at it. I made sure that when an alien dies, whether through hitting the Nachenblaster or through being killed by a projectile, an explosion happens. For my previous versions of the code, I found out that I didn’t make an explosion happen when the Nachenblaster and the alien collides, because I let the wrong functions handle it. In later versions, I found out that I made an explosion happen twice in different places of the code by using control+F.

////////////////////////
// Damageable Objects //
////////////////////////

    DamageableObject(StudentWorld* world, int imageID, double startX, double startY, int dir, double size, int depth, double hitPoints);

// Nachenblaster, Smallgon, Smoregon, and Snagglegon are all objects that can be damaged, so they all need a hit point. So why not make this hit point accessible with these two functions? 
    double getHitPt() const; // Get the hit points
    void setHitPt(double amt); // Set the hit points to be amt

// These two functions are made virtual so they can be redefined in nachenblaster and/ or the aliens
    virtual void incHitPt(double amt); // Increase the actor's hit points by amt
    virtual void sufferDamage(double amt, int cause); // Decrease the actor's hit points by amt

I made sure that DamageableObject couldn’t be initiated directly. And that the incHitPt, setHitPt, and sufferDamage functions do work when I use it to print things on the screen and using cassert.

///////////////////
// NachenBlaster //
///////////////////

    NachenBlaster(StudentWorld* world);
    
// These are specific things that only a Nachenblaster has, so they have to be in here
    int getCabbagePt() const;
    int getTorpedoPt() const;
    int cabbagePercentage() const;
    int healthPercentage() const;
    void setCabbagePt(int newCabbagePt);
    void incTorpedoPt(int newTorpedoPt);

// This is redefined from the DamageableObject class, because Nachenblaster’s hit point cannot exceed 50
    virtual void incHitPt(double amt); // Increase this actor's hit points by amt.

// I choose to let Nachenblaster handle playing sound blast when it’s hit by a projectile as opposed to letting projectile handle it. And I made sure to decrease points, and update alive status if the hit point goes to zero 
    virtual void sufferDamage(double amt, int cause);

// if the user types certain keys, then the Nachenblaster will have to move or shoot projectile as long as it’s alive. And to not increase cabbage point to be above 30
    virtual void doSomething();

I made sure that all the accessors and one-line mutators are doing the correct thing using cassert and also the game status text at the top of the screen. The game status text was actually a way faster way to debug than to create break points in the code, step into, step out of, and step through the code. I made sure that when nachenblaster hits a projectile, the points are actually decreased. I hit all four arrow keys on the keyboard and all worked. I tried the space bar and it did shoot out cabbages and play the sound. Once I got the goodies working, I tried eating a torpedo goodie, and my Nachenblaster did fire torpedoes and made a fart noise. 

///////////
// Alien //
///////////

    Alien(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY, double hitPoint, double damageAmt, double deltaX, double deltaY, double speed, unsigned int scoreValue);

// These are specific traits that only aliens have, and all aliens share. The getDamageAmt() returns the damage amount that Nachenblaster has to take if attacked. Function getDeltaY() returns the direction that the alien plans to go (up being 1.0, down being -1.0, and if it’s only going left, then deltaY should be 0.0). The scoreValue is how much score the user can get when destroying each type of alien. The speed is how many pixels in one direction the alien will move per tick. 
    double getDamageAmt() const;
    double getDeltaY() const;
    double getScoreValue() const;
    double getSpeed() const;
    void setDeltaY(double dy); // Set the player's y direction.
    void setSpeed(double speed);

// The flight plan keeps being updated
    void setFlightPlanLength(double fpLength);

// Since the alien can die in 2 ways: hit by a Nachenblaster or hit by a projectile that it shoots and have a hit point below zero, I made this function to not repeat code. This function does everything that needs to be done when an alien dies.
    void alienIsDying();

// Aliens move according to their flight plan and speed
    void move();

// If an alien collides with the Nachenblaster, then Nachenblaster should sufferDamage
    virtual bool damageCollidingPlayer();

// Aliens suffer damage differently from Nachenblaster does. That’s why it’s virtual since it’s inherited from DamageableObject class
    virtual void sufferDamage(double amt, int cause);

// Drop respective goodies from respective dying alien ships according to the probabilities given. To make something happen with a specific probability, randInt function was very helpful.
    virtual void possiblyDropGoodie();

// If the alien is alive, then it should damage a colliding player, move in one of the three specific ways, with the help of isSnagglegon() function because Snagglegon doesn’t have some implementations that the other two aliens have. For example, a Smoregon and Smallgon can both fire turnips. To account for specific things that only one alien does, I made a doDiffAlienThing() a private pure virtual function that’s called in this doSomething() public function.
    virtual void doSomething();
private:
    virtual void doDiffAlienThing() = 0;

This is the most busy and complicated class of the whole project, so there are many things to check. I used cassert to check for all the one-line functions. Observe with my eyes to ensure that my aliens do move in a way that’s the same as the ones in the example game given by the professor. I printed out the fpLength variable onto the console to make sure that it looked reasonable. I made sure that the Nachenblaster did suffer when each specific alien collides into it by looking at how much the health percentage decreases on the screen. I tried changing the possibility of dropping a goodie to 100% when testing if a goodie really does what it’s supposed to. I made sure that I’m unable to initiate a direct object of type Alien.

//////////////
// Smallgon //
//////////////

    Smallgon(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);
private:
    virtual void doDiffAlienThing();

This has nothing to check, because its doDiffAlienThing function is empty since it’s already covered in the doSomething function of Alien class.

//////////////
// Smoregon //
//////////////

    Smoregon(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);
    virtual bool isSmoregon() const;
private:
    virtual void doDiffAlienThing();

I made sure that all Smoregons do speed up when I change the probability to 100%. The actual percentage that a Smoregon speeds up is too low for me to truly see if it works. After changing the probability, Smoregon did speed up and go straight left. 

////////////////
// Snagglegon //
////////////////

    Snagglegon(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);
    virtual bool isSnagglegon() const;
private:
    virtual void doDiffAlienThing();

To check for correctness, I played out the sound and changed the probability of a Snagglegon dropping a torpedo to be 1. I did see all Snagglgon firing a torpedo and creating a fart noise.

////////////////
// Projectile //
////////////////

    Projectile(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY, int dir, double damageAmt, double deltaX, bool rotates);

// These are traits shared among all three projectiles, and are useful functions to move the projectile or to see how much hit point damage it needs to cost a Damageable object.
    double getDeltaX() const;
    double getDamageAmt() const;

// This function helps reduce a lot of duplicate code. Only cabbage and PlayerLaunchedTorpedo are fired by the Nachenblaster. This is useful because I can also make sure that whatever projectile that is fired by the Nachenblaster can only damage an actor, and vice versa.
    virtual bool isFiredByNachenBlaster() const;

// I need to use a pointer to an Alien to getOneCollidingAlien from the StudentWorld in order to make the alien suffer from damage caused by a projectile fired by the Nachenblaster. Do the same for when the Nachenblaster is damaged by an alien-fired projectile.
    void doCommonThingOnce();

// If the projectile is still alive and on the screen, then doCommonThingOnce(), move to the correct place, maybe rotate, and doCommonThingOnce() again, because maybe the projectile has hit a DamageableObject after it has moved.
    virtual void doSomething();

It was hard to make collision work at the beginning. This was the first class that I tried modifying to handle a collision. Before I had the game status text working, I simply check how many times I had to shoot each kind of alien ship to kill it. And seeing these aliens die reassured that the checking for collision through getWorld()->getOneCollidingAlien really worked. Later on, when I added the game status text, I was able to get completely reassured that the Nachenblaster does suffer appropriate damage.

/////////////
// Cabbage //
/////////////

    Cabbage(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);
// this is true
    virtual bool isFiredByNachenBlaster() const;

The way to check is already described at the end of the Projectile section.

////////////
// Turnip //
////////////

    Turnip(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);

The way to check is already described at the end of the Projectile section.

/////////////
// Torpedo //
/////////////

    Torpedo(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY, int dir, double deltaX);

The way to check is already described at the end of the Projectile section.

///////////////////////////
// PlayerLaunchedTorpedo //
///////////////////////////

    PlayerLaunchedTorpedo(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);
// this is true
    virtual bool isFiredByNachenBlaster() const;

I made sure that this only cause damage to an alien by trying to chase what I fired. 

//////////////////////////
// AlienLaunchedTorpedo //
//////////////////////////

    AlienLaunchedTorpedo(StudentWorld* World, double startX, double startY);

I made sure that this only cause damage to the Nachenblaster by patiently waiting when an alien fired and its projectile went straight through other aliens in front of it.

////////////
// Goodie //
////////////

    Goodie(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY);

// When Nachenblaster and a goodie collides, it is easier to let the goodie check for the collision, because I made a getCollidingPlayer function in StudentWorld that returns a pointer to NachenBlaster. Each goodie actually does its own thing, so I included a doDiffGoodieThing() virtual function.
    bool processCollision();

// If the goodie is alive and on the screen, it has to process collision, move, and then process collision again, because maybe it has collided with the player after it has moved.
    virtual void doSomething();
    
private:
// I made this a private pure virtual function, because a goodie should never be called directly.
    virtual void doDiffGoodieThing() = 0;

I made sure that I cannot initiate a Goodie object. I made sure that the processCollision returns the right thing by printing what it should return onto the console, and seeing a true statement pop up whenever I try to eat a goodie. The f key really helped with debugging, because I can check what’s printed onto the console by freezing the game.

///////////////////////
// Extra Life Goodie //
///////////////////////

    ELGoodie(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY);
private:
    virtual void doDiffGoodieThing();

I checked the game status text that whenever I eat an extra life goodie, the life increases by 1. I actually mixed up the extra life goodie and repair goodie in my head at first, because the repair goodie has a plus sign, which I thought meant plus one extra life. So at first, I was checking the wrong variables with my eyes. And was having trouble finding what I did wrong in the code because everything looked fine. I realized that I mis-recognized the goodie when I checked the asset folder and saw what each tga image looked like.

///////////////////
// Repair Goodie //
///////////////////

    RGoodie(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY);
private:
    virtual void doDiffGoodieThing();

I checked the game status text that whenever I eat a repair goodie, my health percentage goes up by 20, which is double the hit point. 

////////////////////
// Torpedo Goodie //
////////////////////

    FTGoodie(StudentWorld* World, int imageID, double startX, double startY);
private:
    virtual void doDiffGoodieThing();

I checked the game status text that whenever I eat a torpedo goodie, my torpedo count increases by 5, and that I could shoot things out with tab bar, and it did destroy aliens with fewer shots that needed if I were to shoot a cabbage or turnip.

//////////////////
// StudentWorld //
//////////////////

The StudentWorld class inherits from the GameWorld. This file handles all the actions of game play, like creating and deleting players and making each available actor move during every tick. I used a vector of actors to add actors using push_back and delete actors using erase with the help of an iterator. My Nachenblaster is created as a separate pointer, and is not included in the actor vector.

// This is called when the level is being initialized. A new NachenBlaster is created, variables for creating new aliens are reset, and the initial 30 stars are created.
    virtual int init();

// if any actors are alive, they must doSomething according to their Actor subclass implementation. If Nachblaster died, then decrease life, and return GWSTATUS_PLAYER_DIED so the game handler knows that the player died. It is possible that one actor may destroy another actor during the current tick, so remove newly-dead actors after each tick and decrease the number of aliens seen on screen. Create a new star or an alien according to their probabilities, and increase the number of aliens seen on screen accordingly. Use the stringstream type to display a game status line on the top of the file. This really helps with debugging when I could see certain variables on the screen immediately, instead of using break points and tracing through their values.
    virtual int move();

// Every actor in the entire game must be deleted and removed from the StudentWorld’s container of active objects, resulting in an empty level. This happens when NachenBlaster lost a life or has completed the current level. 
    virtual void cleanUp();
    
// this is used for the goodies to call Nachenblaster to increase its hit points or torpedo points
    NachenBlaster* getNachenBlaster();

// If the player has collided with a, return a pointer to the player; otherwise, return a null pointer. This is very useful for handling all collisions with the Nachenblaster.
    NachenBlaster* getCollidingPlayer(const Actor* a) const;

// If there's at least one alien that's collided with a, return a pointer to one of them; otherwise, return a null pointer. This is very useful for handling all collisions with an alien.
    Alien* getOneCollidingAlien(const Actor* a) const;

// An alien may attack if a player is in line of fire.
    bool playerInLineOfFire(const Actor* a) const;

// Add actor to the vector
    void addActor(Actor* a);

// used for Actor class to call when an alien dies
    void recordAlienDestroyed();
    
private:
    vector<Actor*> m_vActor;
    NachenBlaster* m_NachenBlaster;
    // used for computing probabilities to create a specific alien
    int m_AlienDestroyed, m_RemainingAlienToDestroy, m_MaxAlienOnScreen, m_CurrentAlienOnScreen;
    int S1, S2, S3, S;
};

I checked if the game status text is shown correctly on the screen. I also checked the variables used to count how many aliens I may create by printing them out on the console in the move() function. The number of aliens on the screen turned out to be mostly 4’s when in level 1. The sanity check helped me realize that the probability of creating aliens was incorrect. I checked if I get to the next level appropriately by keep shooting aliens. At first, when I’m supposed to advance to the next level, the program stopped at the black screen notifying me that I can go to the next level, and returned me an error. I realized that I didn’t clean up things properly and I had to delete first before I erase. I made sure my init variables were correct by printing them out onto the console.
